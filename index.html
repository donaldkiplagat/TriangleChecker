    <h2>Properties of Different Triangles</h2>
    <h3>Isosceles</h3>
    <img class="Isosceles" src="images/isosceles.png" alt="Isosceles Triangle">
    <p>An isosceles triangle is a triangle that has (at least) two equal side lengths. If all three side lengths are equal, the triangle is also equilateral. Isosceles triangles are very helpful in determining unknown angles.</p>
    <p>In an isosceles triangle, the two equal sides are called legs, and the remaining side is called the base. The angle opposite the base is called the vertex angle, and the point associated with that angle is called the apex.</p>
    <p>The two equal angles are called the isosceles angles. If the triangle is also equilateral, any of the three sides can be considered the base.</p>

    <h3>Equilateral</h3>
    <img class="equilateral" src="images/equilateral.png" alt="Equilateral Triangle">
    <p>An equilateral triangle is a triangle whose three sides all have the same length. They are the only regular polygon with three sides, and appear in a variety of contexts, in both basic geometry and more advanced topics such as complex number geometry and geometric inequalities.</p>
    <p>The most straightforward way to identify an equilateral triangle is by comparing the side lengths. If the three side lengths are equal, the structure of the triangle is determined. However, this is not always possible.
      Another useful criterion is that the three angles of an equilateral triangle are equal as well, and are thus each .</p>
    <p>Since the angles opposite equal sides are themselves equal, this means discovering two equal sides and any  angle is sufficient to conclude the triangle is equilateral, as is discovering two equal angles of 60.</p>

    <h3>Scalene</h3>
    <img class="scalene" src="images/scalene.png" alt="Scalene Triangle">
    <p>Scalene triangle is a type of triangle which has all its three sides unequal in measure. Eventually, it has all its three angles unequal. Thus, we can say that the lengths of sides as well as measure of angles of a scalene triangle are different.</p>
    <h4>Properties of Scalene Triangles</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>There is no line of symmetry which can be drawn through a scalene triangle.</li>
      <li>There is no congruent side in scalene triangle.</li>
      <li>There is no congruent interior angle.</li>
      <li>The angle opposite to longest side is of biggest measure.</li>
      <li>The angle opposite to shortest side is of smallest measure.</li>
    </ul>
