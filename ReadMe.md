## Website Name: Triangle Checker
This website was created in order to take in 3 number values from the user so as to determine whether the values form a triangle and the type of triangle it is during Moringa Prep. This is Week 2's Independent Project.

## Description
The website contains details about each type of triangle as well as the properties of each triangle. The button at the top of the page when clicked will prompt the user to enter the sides of the triangle one wishes to check and bring back an alert of what type the triangle is.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* The github page is currently live thus the following link will take you to the webpage "https://donaldkiplagat.github.io/TriangleChecker/"
* As long as you have a compatible browser the document will work.
* When an empty value is entered an error "Please enter a value" will be displayed.
* When a value that isn't a number is entered an error "Please enter a number" will be diplayed. 
* The values entered will be cross checked with each other to determine which triangle fits those conditions

# Known Bugs
Currently no bug has been identified.

# Behaviour Driven Development
* The program should return "Please enter a number in the field" when an empty value is entered. 
Input Example:" "
Output Example: Please enter a number

* The program should return "Value entered must be a number" when a value that isn't a number is entered.
Input Example: "three"
Output Example: Value entered must be a number

* The program should return "Not a Triangle" when values entered don't make up a triangle.
Input Examples: 
Input 1: 2000
Input 2: 40
Input 3: 5
Output Example: Not a triangle

* The program should return "Equilateral" when values entered make up an Equilateral triangle.
Input Examples: 
Input 1: 20
Input 2: 20
Input 3: 20
Output Example: Equilateral

* The program should return "Isosceles" when values entered make up an Isosceles triangle.
Input Examples: 
Input 1: 20
Input 2: 20
Input 3: 10
Output Example: Isosceles

* The program should return "Scalene" when values entered make up an Equilateral triangle.
Input Examples: 
Input 1: 12
Input 2: 14
Input 3: 16
Output Example: Scalene

## Technologies Used
* HTML was used in making the skeleton of the website.
* CSS was used in styling the document.
